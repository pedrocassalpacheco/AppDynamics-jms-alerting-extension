# AppDynamics jms - Alerting Extension

This extension works only with a dedicated SaaS controller or an on-prem controller. 

##Use Case

jms provides SaaS IT on-call schedule management, alerting and incident tracking. AppDynamics integrates directly with jms to create incidents in response to alerts. With the jms integration you can leverage your existing alerting infrastructure to notify the operations team to resolve performance degradation.

### Prerequisites

- You should have a jms Service Key

##Installation Steps

 1. Run "mvn clean install -DskipTests". You can run the tests by configuring the service key in the config.yaml file in the test resources folder.

 2. Find the zip file at 'target/jms-alert.zip' or Download the jms Alerting Extension zip from [AppDynamics Exchange](http://community.appdynamics.com/t5/AppDynamics-eXchange/idb-p/extensions)

 3. Unzip the jms-alert.zip file into <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/ . You should have  <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/jms-alert created.

 4. Check if you have custom.xml file in <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/ directory. If yes, add the following xml to the <custom-actions> element.
 
   ```
      <action>
    		  <type>jms-alert</type>
          <!-- For Linux/Unix *.sh -->
     		  <executable>jms-alert.sh</executable>
          <!-- For windows *.bat -->
     		  <!--<executable>jms-alert.bat</executable>-->
      </action>
  ```
     
   If you don't have custom.xml already, create one with the below xml content
    
      ```
      <custom-actions>
          <action>
      		  <type>jms-alert</type>
            <!-- For Linux/Unix *.sh -->
       		  <executable>jms-alert.sh</executable>
            <!-- For windows *.bat -->
       		  <!--<executable>jms-alert.bat</executable>-->
     	    </action>
        </custom-actions>
      ```
      Uncomment the appropriate executable tag based on windows or linux/unix machine.
    
    5. Update the config.yaml file in <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/jms-alert/conf/ directory with the Service Key. You can also configure the level of details sent to jms.

###Note
Please make sure to not use tab (\t) while editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a yaml validator http://yamllint.com/

    	
```	
	#jms Service Key
	serviceKey: ""
		
	#scheme used (http/https)
	protocol: "https"
	
	#jms host
	host: "events.jms.com"
	
	#jms url path
	urlPath: "/generic/2010-04-15/create_event.json"
	
	#http timeouts
	connectTimeout: 10000
	socketTimeout: 10000
	
	#show appdynamics details in jms alert
	showDetails: true      
```        
         

Below is how the AppDynamics event's parameters are associated with jms parameters:

	<table>
	<tr>
	<td>AppDynamics Parameters</td>
	<td>jms Parameters</td>
	<td>Comments</td>
	</tr>
		
	
	<tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>service_key</td>

	is created in a jms environment.
	</tr>
		 
	
	<tr>

	<td>event_type</td>
	<td>This field is used for all types of integration APIs available in
	jms. For this specific task we require that this parameter be set
	as "trigger".</td>

2. Installing Custom Actions:

     To create a Custom Action, first refer to the the following topics (requires login):
     * [Creating custom action](http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO14S/Custom+Actions)
     * [Build an Alerting Extension](http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO14S/Build+an+Alerting+Extension)

Now you are ready to use this extension as a custom action. In the AppDynamics UI, go to Alert & Respond -> Actions. Click Create Action. Select Custom Action and click OK. In the drop-down menu you can find the action called 'jms-alert'.

3. Look for the newest created Incident in jms.


   Once an incident is filed it will have the following list view:

![](http://appsphere.appdynamics.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/83i64EA0DAEED76521B/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&px=-1)

   When the **Details** button of this is clicked it will link to a similar page:

![](http://appsphere.appdynamics.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/85iDCB38EF96412EB25/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&px=-1)

   And finally to view the event of the incident in JSON it will look similar to the following:

![](http://appsphere.appdynamics.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/87i53C89765515BD9EF/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&px=-1)
